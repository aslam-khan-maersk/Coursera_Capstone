# Battle of the neighborhoods Part 1

### Problem Statement

How can I determine the best area to launch a personal shopper service during the current restricted pandemic conditions in the Limburg province of Belgium?

During 2020 the coronavirus pandemic has greatly impacted the way in which consumers could transact and interact with all types of businesses, from retail and food service industries to administration services. High risk citizens would find a reasonably priced personal "shopper" service, that would allow them to maintain all the necessary day to day tasks with a minimal additional service cost. In limiting their contact with a single point of contact that would take extra precautionary measures to minise risk of tranmission and increase the hygiene factor of articles handed over.

Looking at statistics from StatBel, approximately 19% of the population of Belgium is over the age of 60. In the Limburg province this is proportionately larger with more than 27% of the provincial population being over the age of 60 and therefore at high risk. In addition to this approximately 14% of the population has some form of disability that impacts their ability to perform tasks. Compared to the larger cities in provinces link Antwerp and more cosmopolitan cities such as Brussels, the Limburg province is large and expansive and the availability of delivery and concierge services are limited. 

Therefore looking at the possible market need in the large Limburg province, the problem I am trying to solve is to determine the 5 best suburbs in Limburg to launch this service, with the easiest access for a small team of shoppers to quickly navigate the area. 

### Data used

In order to determine the best suburbs to launch in I will first look at the various suburbs of Limburg province in Belgium. Using postal code data, I will use this dat to segment the province into the various suburbs. Using location data from Foursquare, I will then determine which suburbs have the most services listed with the greatest variety. These areas would satisfy the criteria of being the best launch targets for the service. Having a variety of options in 1 postal code will allow the service to remain cost effective and efficient.
